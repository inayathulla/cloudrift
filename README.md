Detect drift. Defend cloud.

🔍 **Cloudrift** is an open-source cloud drift detection tool that helps you identify when your cloud infrastructure no longer matches your Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) — before it causes a security or compliance incident.

## ✨ Features (coming soon)

- Catch unmanaged or deleted cloud resources
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines
- Slack/email notifications
- Simple CLI and JSON output
